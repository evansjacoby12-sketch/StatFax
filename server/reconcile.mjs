/**
 * reconcile.mjs — server-side calibration loop
 *
 * Given yesterday's published snapshot (the scored batters with their grades +
 * active badges) and the actual game outcomes from MLB's box-score endpoints,
 * this module builds a per-day reconciliation record and appends it to a
 * rolling 30-day backtest log. From the aggregated log it computes per-badge
 * and per-grade multipliers using the same math the on-device path used to
 * use — sqrt-dampened lift ratios clamped to ±8% — and writes them out as
 * `calibration.json` for tomorrow's cron run to load.
 *
 * Why on the server rather than the device:
 *   The on-device path kept a per-user backtest log in AsyncStorage and
 *   recomputed multipliers from that. Two users with different histories
 *   ended up with different multipliers → different displayed scores for the
 *   same player on the same day. The whole point of the backend snapshot is
 *   that everyone reads the same scores. Moving calibration here keeps that
 *   invariant intact and gives the model real empirical correction at the
 *   same time.
 *
 * Boot-strap behavior:
 *   On the very first run there's no prior log. We score with all multipliers
 *   = 1.0, reconcile yesterday once it's available, and start filling the
 *   log. Across ~6-7 days we accumulate enough records (MIN_SAMPLES = 1500,
 *   ~250 batters/day) to flip `ready: true` in the calibration bundle, after
 *   which the multipliers actually move scores.

// (z≈14), homeEdge (z≈5.8), barrelKing (z≈4.7) are rock-solid, while launchPad
// (z≈1.7) and zoneMaster (z≈2.2) sit at noise. So scale each signal's allowed
// deviation from 1.0 by the statistical strength (|z| vs the overall rate) of
// its OWN measured lift: proven signals earn a wider band and move scores more,
// near-noise signals get pulled toward neutral. z is recomputed from the live
// log each run, so this re-weights automatically as the sample grows — no
// hardcoded audit constants to go stale.

// ── Per-GRADE band is much wider than the per-BADGE band ─────────────────────
// The badge band (±12% max) is right for badges: each badge is a small
// additive nudge layered ON TOP of the raw score, and they stack, so a tight
// cap stops pile-on inflation. But the GRADE multiplier is the score's primary
// empirical correction and it must preserve the grade GRADIENT. With the badge
// cap, both PRIME (lift 2.09 → sqrt 1.45) and STRONG saturated to ~1.12, and
// LEAN/SKIP both floored at ~0.88 — collapsing four distinct grades into two
// values and throwing away exactly the signal grades exist to express. Giving
// the per-grade loop its own wider ceiling (±45%) lets the sqrt-dampened lift
// breathe so PRIME > STRONG and LEAN > SKIP instead of all hitting the cap.
// Sqrt-dampening + the 80-sample floor still guard against small-sample noise.

// z-score of a sub-group's HR rate vs the overall rate (binomial SE under the
// null that the group rate equals overall), and the clamp band that strength
// earns. `deltaMax` is the widest band a fully-trusted signal can earn —
